This document defines how AI/code agents should work with this repository: coding style, compiler/interpreter stages, and testing conventions. Follow these rules when generating or editing code here.

## Coding style

- Don't make symbols public unless asked for or needed
- Constructor methods should provide data for all the fields unless there is default initialization
  - Map values should always be initialized to an empty map

- If multiple structs need to hold same set of fields and implement methods on those fields add \*Base struct and use type inclusion on other structs
  - Make this base struct private
  - Implement the relevant methods on the base struct

- Don't add comments explaining each line of code. If you need to add comments to describe a block of statements then you should extract them to
  a function with meaningful name.

- Each bal/go file should have the correct license header

## Symbols

- IMPORTANT: never store `model.Symbol` as the key in a map, always use a `model.SymbolRef`
- Don't call operations on symbols directly instead call them via compiler context

## Interpreter stages

1. Generate Syntax Tree
2. Generate Abstract syntax tree (AST)
3. Do symbol resolution
4. Do type resolution of top level nodes
5. Do type resolution of inner nodes (function bodies, type narrowing)
6. Semantic analysis
7. Generate Control Flow Graph (CFG)
8. Analyze CFG
   - Reachability analysis
   - Explicit return analysis
9. Desugar AST
10. Generate BIR
11. Interpret generated BIR

Stages 1–10 are the compilation pipeline (source → BIR); stage 11 is the interpreter (BIR execution).

Execution of these stages is defined in `module_context.go` (and `testphases/phases.go` for corpus tests)

## Tests

### Corpus tests

- We have 3 kinds of tests indicated by file name in `./corpus/bal`
  1. valid tests (`*-v.bal`)
     These are expected to run end to end and generate output (outputs are indicated with `@output` comments)
  2. error tests (`*-e.bal`)
     These have errors that should be detected before interpreter (error lines are marked with `@error` comments)
  3. panic tests (`*-p.bal`)
     These would trigger runtime panics in the interpreter

- For valid tests for each stage we have expected output defined in `./corpus/$stage` directory. We have corpus tests that generate the actual output and compare against them
  - Each corpus test accepts `-update` flag that will update expected output to match actual output
  - Each corpus tests will run the interpreter up to that stage.
- IMPORTANT: This is the preferred way of testing for any interpreter stage.

## Commands

- You can run interpreter as `go run ./cli/cmd run [flags] <path to bal file>`

## Profiling

- In order to profile a `.bal` file first you need to get a debug build (`go build -tags debug -o bal-debug ./cli/cmd`)
- Then run the debug build against the bal file `./bal-debug [flag] -prof <path to bal file>`.

### Opening interactive profiler on long running processes

- After running the interpreter with profiling flags run `go tool pprof -http=:8080 http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30` and open `localhost:8080` in the browser

## AST

- Each ast node has a type representing the value you get after evaluating that node
  - For expressions this needs to be determined.
  - For all other nodes (declarations, statements, identifiers, etc) which don't produce a value this is always NEVER

## Type

- To check if a type is singleton type and get it's value use `semtype:SingleShape`
