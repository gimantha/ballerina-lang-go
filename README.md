## Native Ballerina Interpreter

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang-go/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang-go)

[Ballerina](https://ballerina.io) is an open-source, cloud-native programming language optimized for integration. It has built-in support for JSON and XML, first-class constructs for services and concurrency, and structural typing. It is developed and supported by WSO2.

## Goals

This project implements a **native Ballerina interpreter in Go**: compile Ballerina source to **Ballerina Intermediate Representation (BIR)** and interpret the BIR, with a focus on speed, low memory use, and fast startup. Development is organized by **subsets** of the language; each milestone adds support for a defined subset.

- **Progress:** [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang-go/milestones)
- **Subset docs:** [doc/](doc/) (language features and restrictions per subset)

## Usage

### Dependencies

The project is built using the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/). The following dependencies are required:

- [Go 1.24 or later](https://go.dev/dl/)

### Build the CLI

#### Production Build (default)

```bash
go build -o bal ./cli/cmd
```

#### Debug Build

```bash
go build -tags debug -o bal-debug ./cli/cmd
```

### Using Profiling

Profiling is only available in debug builds (compiled with `-tags debug`).

#### Enable Profiling

```bash
# Default profiling port (:6060)
./bal-debug run --prof corpus/bal/subset1/01-boolean/equal1-v.bal

# Custom port
./bal-debug run --prof --prof-addr=:8080 corpus/bal/subset1/01-boolean/equal1-v.bal
```

#### Access Profiling Data

- Web UI: http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/
- CPU Profile: http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30
- Heap Profile: http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
- Goroutines: http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine

#### Analyze with pprof Tool

```bash
# CPU profiling (30 second sample)
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30

# Heap profiling
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap

# Interactive web UI
go tool pprof -http=:8081 http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30
```

### Using the CLI

#### CLI Help

```bash
./bal --help
```

```bash
./bal run --help
```

#### Running a bal source

Currently, the following are supported:
- Single .bal file
- Ballerina package with only the default module

E.g.

```bash
./bal run --dump-bir corpus/bal/subset1/01-boolean/equal1-v.bal
./bal run project-api-test/testdata/myproject
```

### Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test ./...
```
